          <p>Laser hair removal has become a popular method for addressing unwanted hair on the face and body.
            At A&A Medical Spa, we use only advanced technologies for hair removal, such as the CynoSure Elite IQ laser.
            We offer safe and effective laser systems that remove hair from areas like face, arms, legs, chest, back, or
            bikini area.
            If you're tired of using over-the-counter hair removal methods that provide short-term results, we invite
            you to call our office to learn more about laser hair removal.</p>

          <h3 class="types__title">Laser pigmentation removal</h3>
          <p>Hyper-pigmentation is the normal discoloration of the skin that is caused by medication, sun exposure,
            hormonal imbalance and eczema. Post inflammatory hyper-pigmentation is caused by pimples, cysts and nodules.
            It occurs after an injury is healed and results in scarring if not taken care of.
            Age spots, freckles and other minor blemishes are caused by melanin, a substance which gives our skin its
            color. When melanin gathers in one spot, it becomes noticeable as a discolored area. The wavelengths of
            light produced by laser technology are designed to be absorbed by these pigmented areas causing the spots to
            gradually disappear.
            The treatment is quick and any discomfort experienced can be eased with an ice pack.</p>

          <h3 class="types__title">Laser skin rejuvenation </h3>
          <p>“Lunchtime lasers” are essential in addressing red and brown spots, broken blood vessels, skin tone, and
            skin texture
            in a short amount of time, with minimal downtime. If you’re ready to reduce imperfections in your skin,
            these laser treatments will provide results before your lunch break is even over.
            Lasers work by targeting specific molecules within our skin.
            The layer of skin known as the epidermis houses pigment cells, or melanin. Pigment lasers specifically
            target these cells and essentially break them down. Similarly, lasers that are meant to target blood vessels
            shrink the blood vessels within the dermis layer of skin. Unlike any other skin resurfacing treatment, the
            CynoSure Elite IQ laser facial has minimal risk of side effects. Further, it remains one of the most gentle
            and non-invasive lasers that most patients can go right back into work after the treatment.

          <h3 class="types__title">LLaser vein therapy </h3>
          <p>It’s a non-invasive, non-surgical way to remove spider veins permanently. The process involves laser light
            and bipolar radiofrequency energy being used to close off the vein. It is then gradually absorbed by the
            surrounding tissue and disappears. Laser vein removal is incredibly safe, and the risks and side effects are
            minimal. It can be used on both men and women dealing with unwanted veins.

          <li class="faq__item">
            <h5>When should I start treatment?</h5>
            <p>The ideal time to start treatment will depend on your personal goals.
              For example, let's say you're planning a holiday in hawaii in a few months. You might want to arrange your
              treatment schedule so you're ready to go a few weeks before your trip. Think about your goals and discuss
              them with your laser hair removal technician. They'll help you determine when you should book your first
              appointment.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faq__item">
            <h5>What do you mean by laser "radiation"?
              Does it go through the body or cause cancer?</h5>
            <p>Some lasers emit radiation in the form of light. Others emit radiation that
              is invisible to the eye, such as ultraviolet or infrared radiation. In general, laser radiation is not in
              itself harmful, and behaves much like ordinary light in its interaction with the body. Laser radiation
              should not be confused with radio waves, microwaves, or the ionizing x-rays or radiation from radioactive
              substances such as radium.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faq__item">
            <h5>Are there side effects?</h5>
            <p>Before your first hair laser removal appointment, it's important to have realistic expectations. For
              starters, ask your technician if there are any side effects you need to know about. Laser hair removal is
              considered a low - risk treatment option. However, you might want to have your technician perform a patch
              test before your first appointment. This patch test can determine if your skin responds negatively.
            </p>
            <p>You might experience:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>Itching;</li>
              <li>Swelling;</li>
              <li>Redness;</li>
              <li>Discoloration;</li>

              Are they approaching a busy season? Are they booked out for the next few months? If so, you might want to
              discuss scheduling your appointments ahead of time.
            </p>
            <p>That way, you won't risk delays if your technician is overbooked.</p>

            <h5>Haw many treatments do I need?</h5>
            <p>For permanent hair reduction, you'll need to schedule a series of appointments. The lasers will target
              hair during the growth phase. However, your hair will reach this phase at different times. As a result,
              you'll need more than one appointment to target every hair in the treatment area. The number of treatments
              you'll need will depend on your:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Hair density;</li>
                <li>Skin type;</li>

          </li>
          <li class="faq__item">
            <h5>What if I'm taking medication?</h5>
            <p>Let your practitioner know if you're taking any medication before your treatment. You should also inform
              them if you're experienced a skin reaction after specific treatments. They can take a look at your medical
              history to recognize any red flags.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="faq__item">
            <h5>Am I an ideal candidate for laser hair removal?</h5>
            <p>You'll be glad to know that 90% of patients who are considered good candidates report hair loss after
              three to six sessions. However, not everyone is suitable for this type of procedure.
            <p>
              Hair removal treatments work best on fair skin and thick, dark hair. Patients with darker skin will likely
              require more treatments. People with blonde, light-colored hair might have a difficult time with this
              treatment option.
            </p>
            <p>It's important to speak with your laser hair removal technician to determine if you're a suitable
              candidate or not.</p>
